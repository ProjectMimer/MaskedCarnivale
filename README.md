**MaskedCarnivale** allows you to record, or stream your game without displaying Dalamud plugins.

The plugin creates a second window in the background which can be recorded using software like OBS.

Optionally you can also have the window display the game without a UI at all, so you can take immersive recordings.

The plugin menu can be displayed by typing /carnivale in chat or by using /carnivale enable or /carnivale disable to start or stop the window.


**Please note**:

This plugin only hides overlay plugins, plugins which actually modify the contents of the game still will be visible.

For example the dalamud menu itself would be hidden but the dalamud button on the escape menu would still show up and thus it is advised to disable it in the dalamud settings.

Plugins such as penumbra, cammy, and the tweaks allowing you to change the layout of the castbar would still be visible.


To display a mouse cursor enable software cursor ingame, though most streamers currently dont show their cursor anyway.

To move the window use the XY offset in the plugin menu.

The UI can be hidden in the plugin menu.

The plugin menu can be displayed by typing /carnivale in chat.


Have fun streaming the game without suffering bad QoL and horrid latency!



**HowTo Install**

1: Open the Dalamud Settings menu from within the game by clicking the button/menu item or typing /xlsettings in the chat.

2: Go to the Experimental tab and down the bottom under the Custom Plugin Repositories, add the following url into an empty box:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProjectMimer/xivr-Ex/main/repo.json

3: Click on the + at the right side of the window.

4: Click on the Save icon button at the bottom right side of the window.


The plugins should now be available under All Plugins in the Plugins Installer window, accessable via the button/menu or typing /xlplugins.
